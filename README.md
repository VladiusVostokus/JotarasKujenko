## Discord bot

Discord bot, created with discord.js and mongoDB
First of all, this discord bot, will be used on my discrord server, because it's ran locally on my PC.

### Functionality(at the concept development stage)
- Now bot has leveling and balance systems, where user can gain level by writing messages
- to increase the balance of user, use command /daily, to gain 1000(Currently, user cannot be used to buy anything)
- to show balance and level, user can use /balance and /level
some simple commands like:
- /ping to show user's ping
- /add to sum 2 numbers
- /ban, which reply message, but can't ban
- /embed, which send an embed
- /hello reply with "hello!"
  
in future this commands will be deleted or modified, because they are only created to learn how to create some stuff
